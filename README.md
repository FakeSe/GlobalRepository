# GlobalRepository

GlobalRepository is a generic repository that replace all the repositories in your project, in this way you will just need to use one and unique repository which mean to maintain one repository. With GlobalRepository you don't need to create a new repository for each Model and define methods ! just add and use it.

GlobalRepository work anywhere, just download the files, add them to your project and happy use :D 

please remember :
- Don't forget to change the name space...
- Don't forget to add the repository to your services in startup.cs
- If you have BaseEntity.cs class with another name just change the name in the donwloaded files.

PS: to work correctly, your Models must extends BaseEntity, I added a file so You can see how BaseEntity look like (for newbies)
