# GlobalRepository

GlobalRepository is a generic repository that replace all the repositories in your project, in this way you will just need to use one and unique repository which mean to maintain one repository. With GlobalRepository you don't need to create a new repository for each Model and define methods ! just add and use it.

PS: to work correctly, your Models must extends BaseEntity, You can see how BaseEntity.cs look like
